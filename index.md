# Identifying birds in the wildlife trade 
This website and repository is a contribution which evolved from my Master's by Research in the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology at the University of Kent, which was submitted in September 2021. I hope it can be of some use to you! 

My principal supervisor for this work has been [Dr. David Roberts](https://www.kent.ac.uk/anthropology-conservation/people/555/roberts-david) and my secondary supervisor has been [Professor Julio Hernandez-Castro](https://www.kent.ac.uk/computing/people/3110/hernandez-castro-julio) in the School of Computing.
